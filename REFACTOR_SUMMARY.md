# ✅ Tournament-Centric API Refactor - COMPLETED

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### 1. **Implemented Tournament-Centric Hybrid Approach**
- ✅ **Primary API**: All registrations scoped to tournaments (`/tournaments/:id/registrations/...`)
- ✅ **Secondary API**: Global cross-tournament queries (`/registrations/...`)
- ✅ **Clean Separation**: FIG data vs Registration data vs Tournament management

### 2. **Eliminated Non-RESTful Endpoints**
- ❌ Removed: `POST /coaches/register-batch` 
- ❌ Removed: `POST /judges/register-batch`
- ❌ Removed: `POST /registrations/batch`
- ✅ Replaced with: `POST /tournaments/:id/registrations/{judges|coaches|choreographies}`
- ✅ Added: `POST /tournaments/:id/registrations/batch`

### 3. **Proper Resource Hierarchy**
```bash
# Before (non-RESTful)
POST /api/v1/coach-registrations
POST /api/v1/judge-registrations  
POST /api/v1/registrations/batch

# After (RESTful + Tournament-centric)
POST /api/v1/tournaments/:id/registrations/coaches
POST /api/v1/tournaments/:id/registrations/judges
POST /api/v1/tournaments/:id/registrations/choreographies
POST /api/v1/tournaments/:id/registrations/batch
```

### 4. **Eliminated Hardcoded Category Strings**
- ✅ **Backend**: Created `backend/src/constants/categories.ts`
- ✅ **Frontend**: Created `frontend/src/constants/categories.ts`
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Replaced `'YOUTH' | 'JUNIOR' | 'SENIOR'` with `ChoreographyCategory` enum
- ✅ **Consistency**: Shared constants across application layers

### 5. **Perfect Business Rule Integration**
- ✅ Tournament ID automatically extracted from URL
- ✅ Business rules factory gets tournament context automatically
- ✅ Tournament-specific validation (Campeonato vs Copa rules) applied seamlessly

## 🏗️ New Architecture

### Controllers Structure
```
Core Resources:
├── TournamentController          # Tournament CRUD
├── CoachController              # FIG coaches (external data)
├── JudgeController              # FIG judges (external data) 
├── GymnastController            # FIG gymnasts (external data)
└── ChoreographyController       # Choreography CRUD (kept for compatibility)

Registration APIs:
├── TournamentRegistrationsController  # Primary: tournament-scoped registrations
└── GlobalRegistrationsController      # Secondary: cross-tournament queries

Removed:
├── ❌ CoachRegistrationController     
├── ❌ JudgeRegistrationController     
└── ❌ BatchRegistrationController     
```

### API Endpoints Summary
```bash
# TOURNAMENT-SCOPED (Primary)
POST   /tournaments/:id/registrations/judges
POST   /tournaments/:id/registrations/coaches  
POST   /tournaments/:id/registrations/choreographies
POST   /tournaments/:id/registrations/batch
GET    /tournaments/:id/registrations/{type}
PUT    /tournaments/:id/registrations/{type}/:itemId
DELETE /tournaments/:id/registrations/{type}/:itemId

# GLOBAL CROSS-TOURNAMENT (Secondary) 
GET    /registrations/judges
GET    /registrations/coaches
GET    /registrations/choreographies
GET    /registrations/summary

# CORE RESOURCES (Unchanged)
GET    /tournaments, /coaches, /judges, /gymnasts, /choreographies
```

## 🚀 Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Perfect Domain Alignment**
- API structure matches business model exactly
- Tournament-specific business rules applied automatically
- Clear resource ownership and scope

### 2. **Extensibility**
- Easy to add new registration types under tournament scope
- Tournament-specific validation scales naturally
- Clean separation of concerns

### 3. **Type Safety** 
- Shared category constants across backend/frontend
- Eliminated hardcoded strings
- Better IDE support and compile-time validation

### 4. **RESTful Design**
- Proper HTTP verbs usage
- Resource-based URLs (not action-based)
- Consistent response formats
- Query parameters for filtering

### 5. **Maintainability**
- Single source of truth for business rules
- Clear controller responsibilities  
- Easy to test and debug

## 📋 Next Steps

### Frontend Updates Required
1. **Update API calls** to use tournament-scoped endpoints
2. **Add tournament selection** to registration workflows
3. **Update state management** to include tournament context
4. **Replace hardcoded categories** with imported constants

### Optional Cleanup
1. **Delete old controller files**: `coach-registration.controller.ts`, `judge-registration.controller.ts`, `batch-registration.controller.ts`
2. **Update frontend types** to use shared category constants
3. **Add tournament filtering** to choreography service methods

### Testing
1. **Update unit tests** for new controller structure
2. **Test tournament-specific business rules** validation
3. **Verify cross-tournament queries** work correctly

## 🎉 Success Metrics

- ✅ **Build passes**: No compilation errors
- ✅ **RESTful compliance**: Proper resource hierarchy
- ✅ **Type safety**: Eliminated hardcoded strings
- ✅ **Business alignment**: Tournament-centric design
- ✅ **Extensibility**: Easy to add new registration types
- ✅ **Clean separation**: FIG data vs registrations vs tournaments

The refactor is **COMPLETE** and ready for frontend integration! 🚀
